This project is a real-time chat application built using Socket.IO and Node.js, enabling users to send and receive messages instantly. The app uses WebSocket technology to establish a persistent connection between the client and the server, ensuring seamless and real-time communication.
The frontend is created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing a clean and responsive user interface. The backend server is developed using Express and Socket.IO, which handles client connections and message broadcasting. When a user sends a message, it is emitted to the server, which then broadcasts it to all connected clients.
The application demonstrates essential concepts of full-stack development, including frontend-backend integration, WebSocket communication, real-time data exchange, and responsive UI design.
